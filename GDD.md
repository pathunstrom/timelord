# Timelord: A Terminal Based Idle Game

## Conceit

As an owner of the Timer your abilities are limited only by the sands that fall
through.

Spend the sand to buy seconds, minutes, and hours, your life tied to the magic.

Master time travel and time dilation to get more sand, faster.

Master time and become a Timelord.

## Reasoning

Idle games are great, but having to have it running the entire time is not
always possible. Timelord will allow people comfortable with a terminal
interface to play the game their way.

## Constraints

Timelord does not need to be "on" to continue running.

There is not a free click mechanic.

## Primary mechanics

The **Glass** adds sand at one **Grain** per second. This is a simple
accumulator.

The amount of sand that can be held is limited by the **Size** of the
**Glass**.

One of the earliest powers of **Timelords** is **Time Dilation**. **Time
Dilation** gives more grains per second by speeding up time for the timelord.

A **Timelord** has a **Lifetime**. You must buy more **Lifetime** to continue
playing.

An advanced power is **Time Travel**. Get a perfect copy of yourself at your
side with a copy of the **Glass** that is full. This doubles the holding
capacity of the glass.

## Goal

Become immortal and be reborn.
